		Experience
	</h2>
	<p>
		I recently graduated from a Front-End Web Development Course at General Assembly where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery and learned how to be an <em>awesome</em> Front-End Web Developer. During my spare time, I enjoy senior water aerobics, pickling, and spending time with my goldfish, Jerry.
